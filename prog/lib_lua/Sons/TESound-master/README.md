# TESound

TEsound is a sound manager for the Love2D framework. TEsound is intended to make it easier to use sounds and music in your games.

It's under the ZLIB license. If you use the library and your game ends up making a lot of money, its creators politely request that you consider sending a little bit of it their way.
